# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Analysis

The Python code utilizes the Pandas library to analyze a dataset containing information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. It begins by loading the dataset and displaying basic information, including the count of movies and TV shows. The code then explores release trends over the years, visualizing the data with a line plot. Genre analysis is conducted by extracting genres from the "listed_in" column, and the top 10 genres are visualized using a bar plot. Additionally, country-wise analysis is performed by extracting countries from the "country" column, and the top 10 countries with the most content on Netflix are visualized. Throughout the code, Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for data visualization, offering insights into trends and patterns within the Netflix dataset. This code serves as a foundation for a more comprehensive analysis of the dataset, providing a glimpse into the distribution and characteristics of content available on the streaming platform.
